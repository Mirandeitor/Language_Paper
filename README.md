# Language_Paper
Scripts and Data used in the paper entitled Efficiency of scanning and attention to faces in infancy independently predict language development in a multi-ethnic and bilingual sample of 2-year-olds


The Matlab scripts included are:
  - ScriptFixationsI2MC: this script analyses the data extracted from I2MC algorithm and apply RQA
  - extractDataforI2MC: this function returns the neccesary data to extract fixations using the I2MC algorithm
  - obtainNormalisedRecValues: this function returns the normalised Recurrence values from the recurrence matrix using the fixation in X and y coordinates, in combination with the fixation durations.
  - The RQA library from Anderson et al., 2013 has also been included. Please cite the library accordingly if used.
  - The I2MC library from Hessels et al., 2016 has been included. Please cite the library accordingly if used.
  
The data includes:
  - The fixation files extracted from the I2MC algorithm are located in the folder Fixation. There are 10 type of slides (5 chair slides and 5 face slides).
  
 NOTE: The scripts were customed made for this particular ET data and the code may not be very flexible. There can be problem with missing functions that i might have forgotten to upload. If you encounter any trouble, don't doubt in contact me at d.lopez@psych.pan.pl
